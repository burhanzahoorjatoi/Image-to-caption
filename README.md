# 🖼️ Image to Caption Generator

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Image to Caption Generator** is a Python-based application that automatically generates meaningful textual descriptions for images. The project combines **computer vision** and **natural language processing (NLP)** concepts to convert visual content into human-readable captions.

The application is built using **Python** and **Streamlit**, providing an interactive web interface where users can upload an image and instantly receive a generated caption. The project is developed and executed in a **Jupyter Notebook** environment, making it suitable for learning, experimentation, and academic use.

## 🚀 Features

* Upload images easily through a Streamlit interface
* Automatically generate captions for uploaded images
* Real-time caption display
* Simple and clean user interface
* Easy to run and modify in Jupyter Notebook
